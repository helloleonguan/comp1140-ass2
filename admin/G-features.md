Our project implements the following features.

Part One
Pass

Successfully implement BlokGame.legitimateGame().

Distinction

Successfully implement BlokGame.scoreGame().
Successfully implement BlokGame.makeMove() (it should be functionally correct, but it need not make good moves).

Part Two
Pass

A working implementation of a basic Blokus game implemented in JavaFX (supporting just the normal four players).
Executable on a standard lab computer from a runnable jar file, game.jar, which resides in the root level of your group repo.
Successfully implements BlokGame.legitimateGame() and during the game prevents the player from making illegal moves.
Successfully implements BlokGame.scoreGame(), and correctly presents the score for the game.

Credit

The game supports two, three, and four human players, following the suggestions in the rules for two and three player games.
Successfully implements BlokGame.makeMove(), providing an basic computer opponent (need not be a strong player).

Distinction

The game allows a single player to play the eighty four game described in the rules.
The game identifies all unplayable pieces when a turn is being taken (the unplayable pieces could be dimmed, indicating to the player that they are unplayable). An unplayable piece is one that can't possibly be used in the given game state. A given player's game ends once all of their unplaced tiles are unplayable.
