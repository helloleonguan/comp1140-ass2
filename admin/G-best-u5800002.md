I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The Menu class, with the methods relating to selecting the game variation using the choiceboxes, as well as hiding and showing different choiceboxes based of the number of players selected.
  This includes:
     -selectNumber.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty().addListener code in class Menu(), that displays the choiceboxes for different players, depending on the number of players playing and
     -confirm.setOnAction event in class Menu() which encodes the game variation and selects the number of human and computer players
* The fieldpromt textbox in class PlayBoard() and the isValidEncoding() method in class Playboard(), which allows users to strings of encoded pieces and have it drawn on the board.
  It was used primarily for testing purposes, before we had implemented drag and drop functionality for the pieces. The isValidEncoding() method checks if the user inputted text is a valid encoding.

I declare that this is entirely my own work,
